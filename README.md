# <Challenge 4>
## ------------------------------Description-------------------------------

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Why I did this:
I wanted to push my boundries for working in API's.
## Problem solved: 
I was able to create a functional quiz with Javaacript logic.
## Learning journey:
I learned how to:
 -Generate text from JS through the DOM
 -Use event listeners to get the desired results.


## Installation
